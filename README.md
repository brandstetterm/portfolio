# My personal portfolio

With this project I want to create my personal protfolio website, displaying some of my projects, used technologies and other stuff. In the future the protfolio should be visible under [manuelbrandstetter.de](https://manuelbrandstetter.de). I'm using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for development.

## Development

Once you've installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start the development server:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```
